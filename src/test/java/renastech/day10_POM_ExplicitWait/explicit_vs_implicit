WEBDRIVERWAIT CLASS (Explicit Wait)
   -> We use explicit wait If we are waiting for some specific webelement or action to happen.
   - This will wait upto given seconds like implicit wait.(if condition happens on the third second wait will wait for 3 second)
   (it wont wait whole time to get finish it will only wait until condition gets true)

/*
          The Implicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the web driver to
           wait for a certain amount of time before it throws a "No Such Element Exception".
          The default setting is 0. Once we set the time, the web driver will
          wait for the element for that time before throwing an exceptio
         */

 /*
        Explicit Wait
      The Explicit Wait in Selenium is used to tell the Web Driver to wait for
      certain conditions (Expected Conditions) or maximum time exceeded before
      throwing "ElementNotVisibleException" exception.
      It is an intelligent kind of wait, but it can be applied only for specified elements.
