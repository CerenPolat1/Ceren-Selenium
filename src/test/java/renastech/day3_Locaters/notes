//        driver.findElement(By.className("gLFyf gsfi")).sendKeys("Apple");
        //if classname has space in it it is not good idea to use most of the case you will recive an error.
//        driver.findElement(By.className("gLFyf")).sendKeys("Apple");
        //you can remove after space and try to locate if classname is unique


 // if webelement also has classname attribute but it is not unique so it is not good idea to use.
// if id is dynamic means (when you refresh page and if you see id is changing that means is dynamic) it wont be usefull.



6-tagNAme
--you locate using tagname itself
--the usage of this one not too much
--it is good if you want to print same tag names

for ex : if you wanna print all links in the page then you will use this method
driver.findElements(By.tagName(a))
driver.findElements(By.tagName(div))

Utilities Pakage
The reason of using utilities:
 1.to make our code more reusable
 2.easy to maintance
 (in the future if you wanna change something instead of going each class
  you will only change from utilities)

 7-cssSelector
 it has own syntax
 common methods that you can use for css

 1- tagname[attribute='value']
 2- tagname.value -->      (.) means is className in css

 3-tagname#value --> (#) means is id in css

 --you can also go from parent to child
 div[class='er4g'] > a


 8-xpath
 2 type xpath : Absulate and Relative

        1-Absuluate Xpath  ///bunu kullanma  cunku kullanimi kolay ama kullanisli degil cunku developer yeni div falan eklediginde code degisecek
        -start with /
        -you need to start top parent (begning of html code)
        -it is not usefull becasuse it takes from very top from to child

        html
            head
            body
                div
                div
                    div
                        a
                    div
                div
                div
            body
            head
        html

        for ex : /html/body/div/div/a
                 /html/body/div

        if you have siblings you can use [number]. it will pick the siblings for you
                         /html/body/div[2]

2-relative xpath
-- starts with //
-- double // allows you to locate your webelemt from anyehere in html code.
--more usefull wehn we compare for absulate xpath because you can start anywhere in html code


some syntax of using relative xpath

1-//tagname[@attribute='value']-- looks for tagname attribute and value
2-//tagname[contains(@attribute, 'value') --locate webelemnt  with the given value if contains
dynamic id usually has static part and dynamic part
exp:
id = hello123
refresh page
id = hello578
refresh page
id = hello23423
//tagname[contains(@id, 'hello')

3-//tagname[.='text'] --looks for exact text match for any attribute

ex :

        <div class="est">
            <a class "def" href="www.gooogle.com">
         div

         tagname div
         attribute class
         attribute value est

//a[@class='def']
